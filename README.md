# Friend-Computer
Automated Blogging software.

"As a blog owner, you know that keeping fresh content on your blog daily can be a tedious and time-consuming task."---LWOF Spokesperson for BlogDominator.com

There are numerous unethical automated blogging software out there that aims to "produce" content by stealing them from
other people's websites and repackaging them by changing a few words or adding a backlink. Friend-Computer aims to be an
ethical blogging software program, behaving very similar to Automated Insights and Narrative Science. Friend-Computer
will find datasets, analyze them, and then produce readable blog posts. As a result, real content is being produced, not
copy-pasted nonsense.

If this thing actually moves beyond an "elevator pitch" and actually works, then it might be extended to produce more useful reports than just blogging.
